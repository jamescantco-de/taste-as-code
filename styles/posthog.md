# PostHog — Style Reference
> Warm paper desktop pinned to cork — a tactile beige workspace where every interface element is a printed artifact, not a floating panel.

**Theme:** light

PostHog presents as a desktop operating system for product development — a warm, tactile workspace where the page itself is a file manager. A sandy beige canvas (#e1d7c2) sets the desk surface; white application windows with 1px hairline borders float on top, pinned like paper. Radii are aggressively small (4px almost everywhere) and shadows are nearly absent, giving the system a flat, printed, almost editorial feel rather than a glassmorphic SaaS one. Typography pairs Open Runde (geometric warmth, tracking-tight at -0.025em) with IBM Plex Sans Variable (developer-tool precision) and ui-monospace for code. Color is rationed: Signal Blue for live links and active states, Amber for the single primary action, Flame Orange for tags, Moss Green for confirmation. Elevation is achieved through the surface stack (beige → cream → white) and hairline borders, not depth — the whole system reads as paper pinned to a corkboard, not cards floating in space.

## Tokens — Colors

| Name | Value | Token | Role |
|------|-------|-------|------|
| Sandy Desk | `#e1d7c2` | `--color-sandy-desk` | Muted UI surface for disabled controls, low-emphasis panels, and placeholder blocks. |
| Paper White | `#ffffff` | `--color-paper-white` | Application window and card surfaces — the primary elevated layer above the sandy desk, used for main content areas and popovers |
| Cream Paper | `#fdfdf8` | `--color-cream-paper` | Slightly warm off-white for secondary card surfaces and hover states — bridges between the sandy desk and pure white windows |
| Soft Linen | `#eeefe9` | `--color-soft-linen` | Tertiary surface for nested cards, secondary buttons, and subtle washes — the middle stop in the surface stack |

| Deep Moss | `#23251d` | `--color-deep-moss` | Primary text and heading color — near-black with a faint olive warmth, never pure #000 |
| Olive Char | `#4d4f46` | `--color-olive-char` | Body text, secondary icons, and SVG fills — the workhorse neutral that gives the system its slightly earthy character |
| Sage Gray | `#65675e` | `--color-sage-gray` | Muted body text, inactive tab labels, and tertiary content — used when text must recede but remain legible |
| Ash Green | `#9ea096` | `--color-ash-green` | Disabled controls, placeholder text, and low-emphasis icon fills — the gray with just enough green to feel on-brand |
| Faded Pewter | `#b3b3af` | `--color-faded-pewter` | Hairline borders and subtle dividers — slightly cool against the warm canvas |
| Warm Mist | `#bfc1b7` | `--color-warm-mist` | Primary hairline border color — the most frequent border in the system, warm enough to harmonize with the sandy canvas |
| Pure Black | `#000000` | `--color-pure-black` | Icon fills, dark-mode text, and maximum-contrast glyphs |
| Signal Blue | `linear-gradient(90deg, rgb(1, 67, 203), rgb(43, 111, 244) 24.04%, rgb(210, 52, 1) 46.63%, rgb(255, 101, 31) 65.87%, rgb(251, 160, 0) 83.17%, rgb(1, 67, 203))` | `--color-signal-blue` | Blue action color for filled buttons, selected navigation states, and focused conversion moments.; Multi-stop brand gradient spanning blue → blue → orange-red → orange → amber → blue — used for the logo wordmark and occasional text-gradient decoration |
| Amber Glow | `#eb9d2a` | `--color-amber-glow` | Yellow action color for filled buttons, selected navigation states, and focused conversion moments. |
| Dark Amber | `#cd8407` | `--color-dark-amber` | CTA hover and active states, pressed link backgrounds — the deeper shade of Amber Glow |
| Burnished Gold | `#b17816` | `--color-burnished-gold` | Outlined action borders and underline accents on links — the amber system uses this for ghost/outline variants |
| Marigold | `#f1a82c` | `--color-marigold` | Decorative illustration fills, icon accents, and the PostHog logo gradient mid-stop — not for UI controls |
| Flame Orange | `#f54e00` | `--color-flame-orange` | Orange wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content |
| Moss Green | `#6aa84f` | `--color-moss-green` | Green wash for highlight backgrounds, decorative bands, and soft emphasis behind content. Use as a supporting accent, not as a status color |

- **Section gap:** 48px
- **Card padding:** 16px
- **Element gap:** 8px

## Components

### Application Window
**Role:** Main content container that mimics a desktop OS window

White surface (#ffffff), 6px border-radius, 1px solid #bfc1b7 border, no shadow. Contains a title bar with filename (e.g., 'home.mdx') and window controls (minimize, maximize, close). Uses backdrop-filter: blur(8px) on the title bar for frosted-glass effect. Internal padding: 16px 32px. This is the signature container — every major content area lives inside one.

### Sidebar File Entry
**Role:** File/folder representation in the left sidebar

Vertical stack item with a small icon (16-20px) above a text label. Label uses IBM Plex Sans 13px/500, color #4d4f46. Hover state shifts background to #e5e7e0. Active state shows Signal Blue (#2f80fa) icon fill. 4px border-radius on hover backgrounds. Spacing: 8px between icon and label, 16px between entries.

### Amber CTA Button
**Role:** Primary action button — the system's single filled CTA

Background: #eb9d2a, text color: #23251d (Deep Moss), 4px border-radius, padding 6px 12px, font: IBM Plex Sans 14px/500. On hover: background shifts to #cd8407. Border: none. The amber against sandy canvas creates a 'pressed paper sticker' effect. Used for 'Get started – free' and 'Install with AI'.

### Ghost Toolbar Button
**Role:** Icon-only or text-only control in the formatting toolbar

Transparent background, text/icon color #23251d, 4px border-radius, padding 2px 4px. On hover: background #e5e7e0. Used for B/I/U toggles, alignment controls, and toolbar dropdowns. Minimal weight — these are utility controls, not actions.

### Outlined Action Button
**Role:** Secondary action with visible border

Transparent background, 1.5px solid #b17816 (Burnished Gold) border, text color #b17816, 4px border-radius, padding 6px 12px. Used for 'Install with AI' alongside the amber CTA. The gold border signals 'available action' without competing with the filled amber.

### Tab Bar Item
**Role:** Horizontal tab in the content section navigation

Inactive: text #65675 (Sage Gray), IBM Plex Sans 13px/500, no background, 6px 6px 0px 0px top-radius, padding 10px 12px. Active: background #ffffff, text #2f80fa (Signal Blue), 2px solid #2f80fa bottom border. The blue bottom-border is the active indicator — no fill change needed.

### Tag Pill
**Role:** Small categorical badge or status indicator

Full pill radius (9999px), padding 2px 8px, font size 12px/400. Background varies by category: #f54e00 (Flame Orange) for feature tags, #6aa84f (Moss Green) for status, #f1a82c (Marigold) for highlights. Text color: #ffffff for saturated backgrounds, #23251d for lighter ones. The pill shape is the system's only rounded element.

### Hairline Divider
**Role:** Section separator and content boundary

1px solid #bfc1b7 (Warm Mist) horizontal line. Used between content blocks, around card containers, and as window borders. This is the primary elevation mechanism — the system uses borders, not shadows, to define structure.

### Window Title Bar
**Role:** Top bar of an Application Window with filename and controls

Height ~36px, background #ffffff with backdrop-filter: blur(8px), 1px solid #bfc1b7 bottom border. Center filename in IBM Plex Sans 13px/500. Left: tab/icon. Right: window control dots. The frosted glass on this bar is one of the few blur effects in the system.

### Text Link
**Role:** Inline and standalone hyperlinks

Color #111827 (near-black) for standard links, #2f80fa (Signal Blue) for active/live links, #b17816 (Burnished Gold) for links with amber system context. Underline: 1.5px solid matching text color, offset 3px. Font: Open Runde 15px/400. No background change on hover — only underline opacity or color shift.

### Product Feature Card
**Role:** Highlight card for product features in grid layouts

Background: #ffffff, border: 1px solid #bfc1b7, 4px border-radius, padding 16px. No shadow. Contains a small colored icon (Signal Blue, Marigold, or Flame Orange), a heading at 19px/600, and body text at 15px/400. Hover: background shifts to #eeefe9.

### Navigation Bar
**Role:** Top-level site navigation

Transparent background on sandy canvas, no border. Items: IBM Plex Sans 13px/500, color #4d4f46, padding 4px 8px. Active item: color #23251d with 1px #23251d bottom border. 'Get started – free' sits on the right as an Amber CTA Button.

### Illustrated Decoration Panel
**Role:** Decorative illustration area flanking content

Isometric/flat illustrations with thick outlines (2px), warm color palette matching the sandy canvas. Characters and objects use Olive Char (#4d4f46) line work with selective Marigold, Signal Blue, and Flame Orange fills. Illustrations bleed to the right edge — they are not contained in cards.

## Do's and Don'ts

### Do
- Use Sandy Desk (#e1d7c2) as the page canvas — never use pure white or gray as the outer background
- Apply 4px border-radius to all cards, buttons, and inputs — this is the system's signature shape choice and deviation breaks the OS metaphor
- Use 1px solid #bfc1b7 borders for element separation instead of shadows; the system has no floating cards
- Use Amber Glow (#eb9d2a) for the single primary CTA per page; use Burnished Gold (#b17816) outlined buttons for secondary actions
- Apply -0.025em letter-spacing to all Open Runde text at 18px and above to maintain the compact, tight feel
- Use Open Runde for headings and body, IBM Plex Sans for UI controls and nav, ui-monospace for code — never mix roles
- Use Signal Blue (#2f80fa) exclusively for active states, live links, and the 'powered by AI' highlight — it is the only blue in the system

### Don't
- Don't add drop shadows to cards or windows — the system uses hairline borders, not depth, for structure
- Don't use border-radius larger than 6px on containers — 4px is the norm, and larger radii break the 'paper artifact' metaphor
- Don't introduce new chromatic accent colors — the system uses exactly four: Signal Blue, Amber Glow, Flame Orange, Moss Green
- Don't use pure white (#ffffff) as a page background — it must be Sandy Desk (#e1d7c2) or a surface stop in the linen/cream range
- Don't use the PostHog Spectrum gradient for UI controls — it is reserved for the logo wordmark and decorative text
- Don't use rounded pill shapes (9999px) on anything larger than a tag — pills are only for small status indicators
- Don't use pure black (#000000) for text — always use Deep Moss (#23251d) to maintain the system's slightly warm character

## Surfaces

| Level | Name | Value | Purpose |
|-------|------|-------|---------|
| 0 | Sandy Desk | `#e1d7c2` | Page-level canvas — the 'desk' the entire desktop OS metaphor sits on |
| 1 | Pale Stone | `#e5e7e0` | Hover and selected-item backgrounds — subtle surface shift for interactive states |
| 2 | Soft Linen | `#eeefe9` | Nested card and secondary surface — used inside white windows for grouped content |
| 3 | Cream Paper | `#fdfdf8` | Off-white variant for secondary windows and popover surfaces |
| 4 | Paper White | `#ffffff` | Primary application window and elevated card surface — the 'paper' pinned to the corkboard |

## Elevation

- **Modal overlay:** `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25) 0px 25px 50px -12px`

## Imagery

Illustrations are flat, isometric-ish, with thick 2px outlines in Olive Char (#4d4f46). Characters and objects use selective fills from the brand palette — Marigold, Signal Blue, Flame Orange — against the sandy canvas. The illustrations are content-specific (a person at a desk with basketball, a hedge maze with figures) and function as atmospheric decoration flanking the main window. No photography is used. Icons are mono-weight, outlined or filled in Olive Char/Deep Moss, with Signal Blue for active states. The visual language is 'tactile diagram' — everything looks like it could be cut out of paper and pinned to a corkboard.

## Layout

The page models a desktop OS workspace: a full-bleed Sandy Desk (#e1d7c2) canvas with a left sidebar (60-100px wide) containing file/folder icons, a central Application Window (max-width 958px, centered) that contains all primary content, and a right-side illustration panel that bleeds off-edge. The Application Window has a title bar with filename, a toolbar with formatting controls, and a tabbed content area. Navigation is a minimal top bar with left-aligned links and a right-aligned Amber CTA. Content within the window uses vertical rhythm: headings, body text, and feature grids stack with 17-48px gaps. Sections within the window are separated by hairline dividers, not background changes. The overall density is compact — elements are close together with minimal whitespace, reinforcing the 'workspace' metaphor over a 'marketing page' layout.

## Agent Prompt Guide

**Quick Color Reference**
- text: #23251d (Deep Moss)
- background: #e1d7c2 (Sandy Desk)
- card/window surface: #ffffff (Paper White)
- border: #bfc1b7 (Warm Mist)
- accent: #2f80fa (Signal Blue)
- primary action: #eb9d2a (filled action)

**Example Component Prompts:**

1. Create a Primary Action Button: #eb9d2a background, #000000 text, 9999px radius, compact pill padding. Use this filled treatment for the main CTA.

2. Create an Application Window: white background (#ffffff), border 1px solid #bfc1b7, border-radius 6px, padding 32px. Title bar: 36px tall, backdrop-filter blur(8px), filename in IBM Plex Sans 13px/500 centered, window control dots on the right. No drop shadow on the window itself.

3. Create a content tab bar: horizontal row of tabs, inactive tabs in #65675e IBM Plex Sans 13px/500, active tab in #2f80fa with a 2px solid #2f80fa bottom border. Tab background: #ffffff for active, transparent for inactive. Padding 10px 12px per tab.

4. Create a sidebar file entry: vertical stack with a 20px icon above a text label. Label: IBM Plex Sans 13px/500, color #4d4f46. On hover: background #e5e7e0, 4px border-radius. Active state: icon fill shifts to #2f80fa. Spacing: 8px between icon and label.

5. Create a text link: color #111827, Open Runde 15px/400, underline 1.5px solid #111827 offset 3px. For live/active links, change color to #2f80fa. For links in amber-system context, use #b17816. No background change on hover.

## Desktop OS Metaphor

The entire design system is built around a desktop OS metaphor. The sandy canvas is the desk, the white Application Window is a document opened on screen, the left sidebar is a file manager, and the title bar with filename ('home.mdx') reinforces that everything is a file. This is not decorative — it informs every component choice: the 4px radii mimic OS UI chrome, the hairline borders mimic window outlines, the toolbar mimics a text editor, and the lack of shadows mimics flat OS design. New screens should maintain this metaphor: when building a new page, frame it as 'opening a file' or 'viewing a document' rather than a marketing landing page.

## Motion Personality

Motion is expressive but restrained. The system uses 0.15s ease for micro-interactions (color, background, border, fill transitions — 34 instances each), giving a snappy, responsive feel. Longer animations (3-6.7s) use ease-in-out and are reserved for decorative floating illustrations ('scattered-float') and hero carousel fades. The text-gradient-wizard-scroll animation cycles the PostHog Spectrum gradient on the logo. Timing functions skew heavily toward plain 'ease' (1501 instances) over custom curves — the system is not trying to be clever with easing, just consistent.
